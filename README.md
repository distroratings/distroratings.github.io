Welcome to **Distro Ratings**, community led website that tries to rank **Linux**/**Unix** distributions based on their popularity and widespread use.

Currently we rank up distributions based on active **IRC** users count. That's because all major distributions have official support channels and because **IRC** is still very popular among tech-savvy people who make up the major user base. One might argue that this doesn't reflects entire picture of how popular and widespread a distribution is, but currently this is our only way and it doesn't means that it might not change in the future.

**IRC** statistics are updated weekly and entire project source code is hosted on github so anyone can double check all the numbers.

This project is still in progress of data collection, especially that of correct and official distribution logo/website/description information, and openly welcomes any contribution that would improve it's authenticity. Feel free to fork and submit your pull requests
