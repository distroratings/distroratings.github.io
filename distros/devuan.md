### Description
Devuan GNU+Linux is a fork of Debian without systemd. Since the declaration of intention to fork in 2014, infrastructure has been put in place to support Devuanâ€™s mission to offer users control over their system. Devuan Jessie provides continuity as a safe upgrade path from Debian 7 (Wheezy) and a flawless switch from Debian 8 (Jessie) that ensures the right to Init Freedom and avoids entanglement.
