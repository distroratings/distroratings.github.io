### Description
The openSUSE project is a worldwide effort that promotes the use of Linux everywhere. openSUSE creates one of the world's best Linux distributions, working together in an open, transparent and friendly manner as part of the worldwide Free and Open Source Software community.

The project is controlled by its community and relies on the contributions of individuals, working as testers, writers, translators, usability experts, artists and ambassadors or developers. The project embraces a wide variety of technology, people with different levels of expertise, speaking different languages and having different cultural backgrounds. 

The openSUSE distribution is a stable, easy to use and complete multi-purpose distribution.

It is aimed towards users and developers working on the desktop or server. It is great for beginners, experienced users and ultra geeks alike, in short, it is perfect for everybody! The latest release, openSUSE Leap 42.3, features new and massively improved versions of all useful server and desktop applications. It comes with more than 1,000 open source applications.

openSUSE is also the base for SUSE's award-winning SUSE Linux Enterprise products.
